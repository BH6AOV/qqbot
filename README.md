# qqbot
this is a java version qqbot

This qqbot uses coolq to send and receive message. The api is provided by coolq Http api.
Note that, this qqbot is only a test version, and it is specific to the game pcr. Thus, you may find all of its functions are about pcr events.

Currently, this qqbot supports team fight management, simulation of drawing card, sending pictiures, and sending voice. However, you do need your own mysql data base
to make all of these functions work, which means you can not just download it and use it.

Last point, don't try to contact the qq number inside, they are test accounts, thanks.
